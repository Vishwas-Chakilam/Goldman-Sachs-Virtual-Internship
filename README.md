## Project Title

**Goldman Sachs Job Simulation Analysis**

## Description

This project is centered around the analysis of the Goldman Sachs Job Simulation program. The simulation is designed to mimic real-world scenarios that candidates may encounter when working at Goldman Sachs. The project involves cracking leaked passwords using the Hashcat tool, evaluating the current security practices, and providing recommendations for improved password protection. Additionally, the project includes feedback on the overall experience with the job simulation and suggestions for improvement.

## Features

1. **Password Cracking Analysis:**
   - Utilized Hashcat to crack MD5 hashed passwords.
   - Analyzed the security weaknesses of using MD5 without salting.
   - Provided recommendations for stronger password security practices.

2. **Feedback and Evaluation:**
   - Offered detailed feedback on the Goldman Sachs Job Simulation program.
   - Suggested improvements for the program to enhance participant experience and learning outcomes.

## Requirements

- **Hashcat:** A password-cracking tool that utilizes GPUs to crack various hashing algorithms efficiently.
- **MD5:** An outdated hashing algorithm that was analyzed and evaluated within this project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Hashcat:**
   - Visit the [Hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) to download and install the latest version.
   - Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

2. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Use the provided MD5 hashed passwords in the analysis section.
   - Run Hashcat with appropriate commands to crack the passwords and analyze the results.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Review the cracked passwords and compare them with the organizationâ€™s current password policies.
   - Provide recommendations based on the findings.

## Recommendations for Future Work

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Implement stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
  - Introduce salting to protect against rainbow table attacks.
  - Enforce more stringent password complexity requirements.

- **Program Feedback:**
  - Include detailed feedback for participants after each simulation task.
  - Expand scenarios to cover more departments and roles within Goldman Sachs.

## Contributing
